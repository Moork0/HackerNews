# HackerNews
This project is a desktop client written in C++/Qt (QtQuick) for accessing Hacker News content. It provides features for voting, viewing and posting comments, submitting news, and opening links. Unfortunately, some features, such as logging in to accounts, sometimes stop working due to the lack of a proper API.
